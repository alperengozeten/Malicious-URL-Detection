# Malicious URL Detection
* In this project, an initial feature engineering has been made on the ["Malicious URLs dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset) on Kaggle, which contains a raw list of URLs that are labeled as malicious or benign. Literature on the topic has been investigated to extract the most informative features for the task.
* 4 different machine learning models have been implemented from scratch without the use of any machine learning frameworks, including ANN, Logistic Regressor, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Models.
* Various metrics have been used in comparing the quality of the model predictions, and the obtained results can be reached from this [report.](https://github.com/alperengozeten/Malicious-URL-Detection/blob/master/final_report.pdf).
